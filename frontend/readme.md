# 🪙 Custodial USDT — Admin Panel (Aptos Testnet)

This project lets you **deploy and manage a simple USDT-like token** on the Aptos Testnet.  
It includes a Move smart contract and a small web UI to interact with it.

---

## 🧱 1. What’s Inside

- **Move Contract (`custodial_usdt.move`)**  
  Stores balances, allows admin control, reset functions, and transfers.  
- **Web UI (HTML + JS + CSS)**  
  Lets you connect your Petra wallet and use all contract features easily.

---

## ⚙️ 2. Setup the Contract

### Step 1 — Install Aptos CLI
```bash
npm install -g aptos
```

### Step 2 — Create a folder and init
```bash
mkdir reset-token && cd reset-token
aptos init --profile admin --network testnet
```

### Step 3 — Add your address to `Move.toml`
```toml
[addresses]
sportsbook_platform = "<YOUR_ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS>"
```

### Step 4 — Add the contract file
Place your `custodial_usdt.move` inside the `sources` folder.

### Step 5 — Compile & Publish
```bash
aptos move compile --named-addresses sportsbook_platform=<YOUR_ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS>
aptos move publish --profile admin --named-addresses sportsbook_platform=<YOUR_ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS>
```

### Step 6 — Initialize
```bash
aptos move run --profile admin --function-id <YOUR_MODULE_ADDRESS>::custodial_usdt::initialize
```

2. Deposit → `10000`

If you want a different wallet to become admin:

2. Re-publish with the new address:
   ```bash
   aptos move publish --profile admin --named-addresses sportsbook_platform=<NEW_ADMIN_ADDRESS>
   ```
